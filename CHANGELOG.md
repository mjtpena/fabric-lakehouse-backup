## Version 1.0.0 (Legacy)

### Basic Features
- Simple table backup to CSV format
- Basic file copying
- Manual restore process
- Limited error handling

### Limitations
- No unified backup format
- Manual configuration required
- Limited storage options
- No verification capabilities

## Upgrade Path

### From Version 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

1. **Backup Format Migration**:
   - Use the migration helper script: `scripts/migration-helper.py`
   - Old backups remain compatible but lack new features
   - Recommend re-backing up with new format for full benefits

2. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Move from inline parameters to `config.json`
   - Update notebook parameter cells
   - Enable new features like performance monitoring

3. **New Capabilities**:
   - Enable unified ZIP backups for space efficiency
   - Use selective restore for faster partial recoveries
   - Implement performance monitoring for optimization

### Breaking Changes
- Parameter structure has changed (backwards compatible with warnings)
- New dependency on `zipfile` and `BytesIO` for unified backups
- Enhanced error handling may surface previously hidden issues

### Migration Script Usage
```python
from scripts.migration_helper import migrate_backup_format

# Migrate old backup to new format
migrate_backup_format(
    old_backup_path="path/to/old/backup",
    new_backup_path="path/to/new/backup",
    include_verification=True
)
```
